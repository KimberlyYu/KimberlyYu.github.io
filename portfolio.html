        <h2>AmbientFlix - Netflix Internship with Codelabs</h2>
        <p>Under the mentorship of Netflix senior software engineers, Ed Bukoski and Joel Brinkman, I worked with 5 other members to produce a movie recommendation system based on the user's ambient environment—weather, news, Spotify music, Twitter feed, location, and soon, Yelp. Accepted to the Advanced Track meant for college students as a high school student.</p>
        <h2>Arcadia High Mobile App</h2>
        <p>After almost a year of work, AHS Mobile App was successfully launched on August 13, 2020. It provides Arcadia students, parents, and staff access to important school information and resources. 
           Currently, we have 775 daily users and put out almost 30 articles every week combined with each article's own push notifications. The front-end of the iOS app was built using Swift and Obj-C while the Android app was made with Java. Graphic Designers
           created UI/UX designs, which were translated to code by the programmers.
        </p>
        <h2>Arcadia High Mobile Content Editing Website</h2>
        <p>In order to input articles, remove articles, and send notifications to the user's phone, we needed a backend. Thus, my sister and I created the Content Editing Website using html, css, and javascript.
            We used Firebase's authentication, hosting, and notification services to sign users in and out, deploy and host our website, and send push notifications to the many people in Arcadia who use the app.
        </p>
        <h2>UCSC COSMOS - Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Cluster</h2>
        <p>Under professors Narges Norouzi and Snigdha Chaturvedi, I worked with 3 other members to predict the prices of homes with 28 different price-relative features in Ames, Iowa using Multivariate Linear Regression. Gradient Descent was used to get closer to the local minimum. Had an accuracy of 81% after __ epochs. Limitations were caused by the Curse of Dimensionality. Next steps would be to ___.</p>
        <h2>kimberlyyu.github.io</h2>
        <p>One of my projects is this very website! I started this personal website as a way to destress and improve my coding skills. While working
            on this project, I realized how creative programming can be. Not only can I put my artwork as images in this website, I could test my creative limits through the versatility and
            endless possibilities of html, css, and javascript! (Hopefully you already found the easter egg by hovering over the squirrel in the homepage :3 )

        <h2>StressLief - Mental Health Awareness App</h2>
        <p>StressLief—a term I coined by joining the words Stress and Relief together. This project was initiated by the AHS App Probation Team as a project highlighting our collaboration and efficiency.
           Mental health is a large problem at our school where numerous students only have less than 6 hours of sleep per day due to high workloads and stress. With this app, we hope to help provide articles
           on ways to combat procrastination, depression, stress, and many other issues.
